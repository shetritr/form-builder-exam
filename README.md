### Forms List Page
This page will include a list of all forms and a link to create new form.

The list of forms is a table with the following columns:
 1. Form id
 2. Form Name
 3. Number of Submissions
 4. link to Form Submit Page
 5. link to Form Submissions Page

For Example:

| Form Id | Form Name       | # Submissions | Submit Page | Submissions Page |
|:-------:| --------------- | ------------- |:-----------:|:----------------:|
| 1       | Task Feedback   | 0             | [View](#form-submit-page)   | [View](#form-submissions-page) |
| 2       | Job Application | 152           | [View](#form-submit-page)   | [View](#form-submissions-page) |

### Form Builder Page
In this page, you'll implement a wizard to create form. You will see a form, where you enter **field label**, **input name** and **input type** and press on an "Add Field" button in order to add this form. the field label and input name are free text, and the input type is of the following input types: **text, color, date, email, tel, number** (you can read more here - [HTML input types](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp)).

After adding a field you should see your input with the label on the screen. When you are done adding fields you should enter **Form Name** and press on the save button in order to add the form to your forms list and redirect to the form-list.

### Form Submit Page
For an url with the id of the form, you will see all the fields you created in the **Form Builder Page**, and a submit button. on submit, all data will be saved to the **Form Submissions Page**.

### Form Submissions Page
For an url with the id of the form, you will see all the form submissions in a table when each header is the field name, and each row is a submission with the user input.
