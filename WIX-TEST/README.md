# WIX-TEST
info: 
I used Node.js, React and mongo.Db to build the server, clinet and the DB.
instructions:
1. Pull the project.
2. Open cmd and go to project folder. 
3. Run npm install.
4. To run the mongo.Db you will need to open another cmd and run "mongod --port 27017 --dbpath /data/db".
5. Run npm start.
6. Wait till you see "Express listening on port  *number of port*", by default it's 3030.
7. Copy the port and write "localhost:" the number of the port.
